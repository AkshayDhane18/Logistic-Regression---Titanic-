# Logistic Regression-Titanic-
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting survival on the Titanic using logistic regression. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, which provides information about passengers on board the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.
The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and fare.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is included in the repository (titanic.csv). It contains the following columns

1. PassengerId - Indicates the passenger number
2. Survived - Indicates if the passenger travelled is survived or not.
3. Pclass - Indicates which class passenger belows
4. Name - Provides Names details of passenger
5. Sex - Indicates sex/gender of passenger
6. Age - Indicates age of passenger
7. SibSp - Provides information about number of sibiling/spouse accompaning
8. Parch - Provides information about number of parents / children aboard the Titanic
9. Ticket - Ticket number
10. Fare - Passenger fare
11. Cabin - Provides information about Cabin number, NaN specifies no cabin allocated
12. Embarked - Port of Embarkation

## Dependencies
The project is implemented using Python and requires the following dependencies: 

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
5. Sklearn
